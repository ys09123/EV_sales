# ⚡ EV Charging Infrastructure Planner

## 🌍 Overview

As electric vehicle (EV) adoption accelerates globally, many regions face a shortage of charging infrastructure. This AI-powered project uses real-world EV data, charger locations, and clustering algorithms to identify underserved regions and suggest optimal sites for new public EV charging stations.

The project includes a **Jupyter Notebook** for data processing/analysis and a **Streamlit Dashboard** for interactive visualization.

---

## 📈 Problem Statement

While EV stock is growing exponentially, public charging infrastructure isn’t keeping pace everywhere. This project addresses:

- Where is EV adoption growing fastest?
- Which regions are underserved by chargers?
- How can we recommend high-impact locations for new stations?

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze EV stock and charger data by region using ISO country codes.
- Identify underserved areas using **K-Means clustering**.
- Visualize spatial disparities using **Voronoi diagrams**.
- Recommend optimal new charger locations based on calculated density.
- Provide an interactive **Streamlit Dashboard** for stakeholders.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Category        | Tools/Libraries |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Language** | Python 3.x |
| **Data Analysis** | Pandas, NumPy |
| **Geospatial** | Geopy, Folium |
| **Visualization** | Matplotlib, Seaborn |
| **Clustering** | Scikit-learn (KMeans) |
| **API Integration** | OpenChargeMap API (Requests) |
| **Dashboard** | Streamlit |

---

## 🧠 Methodology

### Step 1: Data Ingestion & Geocoding
Load `EV.csv` to analyze historical EV stock. Use `Geopy` to map country names to Latitude/Longitude coordinates and standardize country names to ISO codes.

### Step 2: API Data Fetching
Query the **OpenChargeMap API** using dynamic ISO codes to fetch real-time public charging station data for mapped regions.

### Step 3: Feature Engineering
Calculate **Charger Density** (Chargers per EV stock) and prepare the dataset for machine learning.

### Step 4: Clustering Model
Apply **K-Means Clustering** to classify regions into three priority categories:
- 🔴 **High Priority:** High EV stock, low charger density.
- 🟠 **Medium Priority:** Moderate balance.
- 🟢 **Low Priority:** Adequate infrastructure.

### Step 5: Interactive Dashboard
Visualize the clustered data on an interactive map using **Streamlit**, allowing users to explore infrastructure gaps geographically.

## 🚀 Running the Project
Prerequisites:
Ensure you have Python installed. Install the required libraries:
```pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn folium streamlit geopy requests```

1. Run the Analysis (Data Generation)
First, run the Jupyter Notebook to fetch the latest API data, perform clustering, and generate the df_cluster.csv file.

Open ev_sales.ipynb.

Add your OpenChargeMap API Key in the API function.

Run all cells to save df_cluster.csv.

2. Launch the Dashboard
Once the CSV is generated, launch the interactive dashboard:

```streamlit run app.py```

## 📊 Key Results
Cluster 0 (Red): Identifies markets like the USA or Germany where EV adoption outpaces infrastructure growth.

Cluster 1 (Orange): Emerging markets with growing demand.

Cluster 2 (Green): Regions with sufficient coverage relative to current EV stock.
